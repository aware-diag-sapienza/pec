One of the challenges this research area poses is the availability of progressive solutions able to produce early partial results with controlled quality, while providing the analyst with feedback on the progression status and quality. The paper contribution is a progressive clustering technique that satisfies these goals. The proposed solution has been inspired by ensemble clustering methods, that combine a set of clusters from the same data to produce a better result, and by the iterative nature of k-means, this paper explores the challenging idea of using the intermediate results produced by $r$ parallel threads iterations to deliver a sequence of partial results that can be usefully exploited in a progressive analysis.
The partial results are produced using a consensus method and suitable metrics, collected along this process, inform the user on the progression state allowing her to steer/terminate the overall analysis. Moreover,
the paper contributes an analytics to identify reliable early termination thresholds with quality comparable to the final results and build on top of it a Visual Analytics system to allow progressive exploration, steering and refinement of the clustering results. The proposed solution is tested against two use cases and an expert evaluation, showing the advantages in terms of saved time and versatility of analysis."
